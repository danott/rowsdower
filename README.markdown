# ROWSDOWER!

Add some zap to any page on the internet with jQuery. After jQuery is available on the page, simply include this script via:

    <script src="https://raw.github.com/danott/rowsdower/master/min/rowsdower.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

## Bookmarklet

There is a bookmarklet version. The link cannot be placed in the Readme, so a alternative source will come soon.
